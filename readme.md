## Digital Design and FPGAs
### Indiana University
### Spring 2022

During the first half of this class, I had the opportunity to work on implementations of various serial communication protocols like SPI, UART, and I2C.

The second half focused on FPGA design using SystemVerilog, implementing some small "toy" projects and culminating in a fully SPI-compliant peripheral running on a Basys3 board.
